<name>lmc</name>
<music>/path/music/</music>

Option direct list:
Example: keyboard touch "a" to directly switch to the first list and "b" for the second (max 5 lists)
<event>
<name>list1</name>
<value>a</value>
<device>
  <type>keyboard</type>
  <id>0</id>
</device>
</event>
<event>
<name>list2</name>
<value>b</value>
<device>
  <type>keyboard</type>
  <id>0</id>
</device>
</event>
