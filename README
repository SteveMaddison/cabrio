Version from "Livemamecab" 

- Fix ffmpeg problem -> need libavcodec and libavformat 53
- New option "video loop" for snap
- New option "video sound" for snap
- New option "theme sound" music theme onf/off
- Save selection game state at cabrio start

New options needed:

<video-loop>false/true</video-loop>
<video-sound>false/true</video-sound> *
<theme-sound>false</theme-sound>

* Now works with libavcodec54 but without (libavcodec53 is needed), sorry

Cabrio is an emulator front-end primarily designed for use with arcade
cabinets. It features a simple graphical interface which is easy to use
with limited controls (e.g. a joystick).
